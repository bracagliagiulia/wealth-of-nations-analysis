# The Wealth of Health: Exploring the Link Between Healthcare Systems and National Prosperity

## Overview
This project investigates how the **quality and strength of a nation's healthcare system** relate to its **economic prosperity** and **overall quality of life**.  

Using data from the **World Bank Open Data portal**, the analysis explores how indicators such as **healthcare expenditure**, **life expectancy**, **infant mortality**, and **GDP per capita** interact across different countries and over time.  

The goal is to uncover patterns showing whether nations with **stronger economies** tend to build **higher-quality healthcare systems**, and how that translates into **better population health and longevity**.

## Objectives
- Examine global patterns in healthcare investment and outcomes.
- Analyze correlations between **GDP per capita**, **healthcare spending**, and **health outcomes** (life expectancy, mortality rates).
- Visualize differences between countries and regions.
- (Bonus) Build an interactive dashboard for exploring healthcare and economic data over time.
