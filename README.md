# wealth-of-nations-analysis

Exploring the relationship between economic prosperity and population well-being using World Bank data.

## Overview
This project investigates how a country's economic indicators, such as GDP per capita, relate to population well-being.  
We use a CSV file containing data for multiple countries and apply basic Python techniques to analyze it.

## Objectives
- Load and read data from a CSV file using basic Python.
- Identify missing data in the dataset.
- Calculate simple statistics, like average GDP per capita.
- Visualize data using simple plots with `matplotlib`.

## Data Source
All data is stored in the CSV file `worldbank_healthcare_data.csv` located in the `data` folder.

## Python Libraries Used
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)
- No advanced libraries are used in this version.

## Analysis
- Read the CSV file line by line.
- Count rows with missing data.
- Calculate average GDP per capita.
- Plot the first 50 countries' GDP using a simple line chart.
